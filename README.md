For this week's project, my idea is a social network for coders to connect on, called Encipher. Similar to Stack Overflow, coders can post code issues they are having, or post anything that is related to tech.

I enjoyed developing this week's project as there was a sense of achievement when things worked. The assignment kickoff demo really helped me get started and it was useful because the code could be re-used elsewhere in the project with tweaks to the logic. It was also helpful we had most of the week to work on it, which meant I could play around with styling, which I lacked in last week's project.

I have achieved the basic requirements of the project and a few stretch goals, such as enabling users to delete their posts and seeing other people's post in the 'Timeline' tab. I used the Menubar component from Radix and used Tailwind to add a colour change effect on hover. If I have more time I would like to build out this application more and incorporate more of the stretch goals and UI so it's a more seamless and pleasant experience.
